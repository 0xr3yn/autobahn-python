API Reference
=============

The following is a complete API reference of |Ab|.

This isn't intended for learning how to program with |Ab|, since it doesn't explain how parts work together. It is useful to lookup things like parameter names and types.

Also note that this is a *complete* reference of both the *public* API and the *internal* API of |Ab|. As a user, you should only rely on the *public* API, since internal APIs can (and often do) change without any guarantees.
