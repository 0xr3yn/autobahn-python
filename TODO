
RPC Open Questions
==================

0.
Order of args: procid, arg OR arg, procid

1.
Take dependency on jQuery and use Deferred from there, or
integrate our own/someone's Deferred with Autobahn JS?

2.
RPC Server Classes
- only check for RPC funs on class derived from AB WS Protocol or
- register(BaseUri, RpcClass)


Test Suite
==========

Allow to specify case exclusion patterns.

Test Cases

  - split out 6.4.3 to a new test section: "Implementation Limits" => see how behaves
  - UTF-8 fail fast: differentiate 4 behaviors
      1. only when complete message was received
      2. only when complete frame was received
      3. only when complete octets for encoded integer was received
      4. as soon as invalid octet is received

   Currently, there are tests to distinguish between 1., 2. and 4.
   So for completeness, there need to be tests to differentiate between 3. and 4.

  - allow "fail connection" = "immediate TCP close" OR "WS close handshake"
  - Opening/Closing Handshake
  - Server-to-Client Masking
  - Message Roundtrip Time / Latency

Test Report

  - Timestamps in Wirelog


Python
======

WebSocket Protocol

  - allow FIN = true on beginMessageFrame instead of endMessage

  - Further optimize masking: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2119761/simple-python-challenge-fastest-bitwise-xor-on-data-buffers

  - check NumPy for masking
