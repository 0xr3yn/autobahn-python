This demonstrates the use of the MQTT bridge now included in
Crossbar.io

You need to install "paho-mqtt" to run the MQTT client which you can
do via pip:

   pip install paho-mqtt

Then, with the crossbar router running from "examples/router" dir you
can start up either the WAMP or MQTT client first (ideally in
different shells):

   python wamp-client.py
   python mqtt-client.py

They both subscribe to "mqtt.test_topic" and then publish some data to
that same topic (so try starting them in different orders etc).
